The INDRA was developed with funding from ARO grant W911NF-14-1-0397,
"Programmatic modelling for reasoning across complex mechanisms" under
the DARPA Big Mechanism program, and the INDRA database was developed
as an extention of that core project. Work has continued under
W911NF-14-1-0391, "Active context" under the DARPA Communicating with
Computers program, and the DARPA Automated Scientific Discovery Framework
project.
