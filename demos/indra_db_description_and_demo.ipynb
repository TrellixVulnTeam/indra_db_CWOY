    "## The Need-to-knows of INDRA\n",
    "\n",
    "As the name suggests, this database is built using the tools of INDRA, and in turn it can be used to help with many uses of INDRA. It is thus valuable to go over some key features of the INDRA toolbox.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The INDRA Statement\n",
    "The bread and butter of the INDRA Database, and of INDRA itself, is the INDRA Statement, which is described extensively [here](file:///home/patrick/Workspace/indra/doc/_build/html/modules/statements.html). These Statements provide a robust and fairly extensible format for representing mechanistic interactions as Python objects. For the purposes of this tutorial, it is essential to know that Statements:\n",
    "- Have a **type**, for example:\n",
    "    - Phosphorylation\n",
    "    - Complex\n",
    "- Have **agents**, which in turn have some **db refs**, for example:\n",
    "    - MEK has the Famplex db ref id MEK\n",
    "    - Vemurafenib is an agent with the db refs for a CHEBI id \"CHEBI:63637\" and a ChEMBL id \"ChEMBL1229517\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "Most have two agents, a subject and an object, for example:\n",
    "- `Phosphorylation(MEK(), ERK())`\n",
    "- `Inhibition(Vemurafenib(), BRAF())`\n",
    "\n",
    "but there are some types of Statement that are notable exceptions:\n",
    "- Complexes (any number of agents)\n",
    "- Auto-Phospohorylations (one agent)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sources of INDRA Statements\n",
    "INDRA has implemented tools for loading and generating these Statements from several sources. Here, the key points to recall are that:\n",
    "- INDRA can draw from both from **machine reading systems** such as REACH, and from **mechanism databases**, such as Pathway Commons\n",
    "- For readings, INDRA also provides the groundwork for **running certain readers at massive scales**, fairly easily using AWS Batch.\n",
    "- The results from these sources, especially when combined, **contain a lot of duplicate and closely related information**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preassembly of INDRA Statements\n",
    "To build useful models from all these sources, INDRA supplies tools to perform what is call \"preasssembly\" (what you do before \"assembling\" your model), in which:\n",
    "- grounding is regularized (fixes agent db refs), as are protein sites and agent names.\n",
    "- the **redunant information between sources is merged, *with the original source information and evidence preserved*, into a distilled set of unique mechanisms**\n",
    "- the relationship between similar mechanistic information is recorded, such that a more general Statement, such as `Phosphorylation(MEK(), ERK())` can be identified as generalizing `Phosphorylation(MAP2K1(), MAPK1())`.\n",
    "- **Such Preassembled Statements can be uniquely identified by a hash generated from their contents**.\n"

      "Visual expertise induces changes in neural processing for many different domains of expertise. However, it is unclear how expertise effects for different domains of expertise are related. In the present fMRI study, we combine large-scale univariate and multi-voxel analyses to contrast the expertise-related neural changes associated with two different domains of expertise, bird expertise (ornithology) and mineral expertise (mineralogy). Results indicated distributed expertise-related neural changes, with effects for both domains of expertise in high-level visual cortex and effects for bird expertise even extending to low-level visual regions and the frontal lobe. Importantly, a multivariate generalization analysis showed that effects in high-level visual cortex were specific to the domain of expertise. In contrast, the neural changes in the frontal lobe relating to expertise showed significant generalization, signaling the presence of domain-independent expertise effects. In conclusion, expertise is related to a combination of domain-specific and domain-general changes in neural processing.\n"
